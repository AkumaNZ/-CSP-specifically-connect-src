# -CSP-specifically-connect-src
Help please)
To be able connect to a websocket, a site must not have restricted content security policy (CSP), specifically connect-src. Fortunately this can be bypassed by opening a new window, which does not have CSP, and communicating through window objects in javascript.
How do I do that? can you please provide screenshots or sth?
